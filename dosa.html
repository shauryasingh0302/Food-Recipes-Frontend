        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup rice (preferably parboiled)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup urad dal (split black gram)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (optional)</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Water (as needed for batter)</li>
            <li>Oil or ghee (for cooking)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and soak the rice and urad dal (along with fenugreek seeds) separately for at least 4-6 hours.</li>
            <li>Drain the soaked ingredients and blend them together in a mixer or grinder, adding water gradually to form a smooth batter.</li>
            <li>Transfer the batter to a bowl, cover, and let it ferment overnight or for 8-12 hours until it rises.</li>
            <li>Once fermented, add salt to the batter and mix well. Adjust the consistency with water if needed.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick pan or griddle on medium heat. Grease lightly with oil or ghee.</li>
            <li>Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the pan and spread it in a circular motion to form a thin layer.</li>
            <li>Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges and cook until the bottom is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Flip the dosa and cook for another minute. Remove and serve hot with chutney or sambar.</li>
        </ol>
